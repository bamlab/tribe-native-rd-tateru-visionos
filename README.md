## Description
Welcome to our project! This is a Jenga App made for Apple Vision Pro. This is a single-player game (for now). With this App, users can play jenga without create tower on their own. With the scoreboard, you can this how fast you are and how many wooden blocks you can remove. We hope you enjoy, and we look forward to your contributions!

## How to install
[Download](https://xcodereleases.com/) a version of Xcode with visionOS as SDK (Tested with Xcode 15.0 Beta 8).  
On Xcode download visionOS simulator and now you can run the app.

## How to play
Like we said above, this is a single-player game.  
There are some important objects in this game:
* The tower of wooden blocks.
* The silver plate on which rest the tower.
* The transparent zone below the silver plate, this zone determines if any wooden block as fallen from the tower, if a wooden block touch this zone, it's game over.
* The deposit area (red circle), it is used to place a wooden block when you're removing it from the tower.  

To win the game, you have to remove two wooden blocks of each floor except the last one.
